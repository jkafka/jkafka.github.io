I am a PhD-trained public health researcher dedicated to the prevention of violence, including intimate partner violence, firearm violence and suicide. The purpose of my research is to improve the our ability of various agencies and organizations in the US to prevent all types of violence and injury. I believe that to prevent harm, we need to understand the social and structural forces that lead people to engage in harm in the first place, and to consider how and where to find and support individuals who are at the greatest risk. I am a social epidemiologist specializing in the use of mixed methods including integration of qualitative methods, text mining, natural language processing, quasi-experimental research designs, and epidemiological surveillance approaches.

Currently, I work as a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Washington in the [Firearms Injury & Policy Research Program](https://sph.washington.edu/public-health-research/FIPRP) under the mentorship of [Dr. Fred Rivara](https://sph.washington.edu/sph-profiles/faculty-profiles/fred-rivara) and [Dr. Ali Rowhani-Rahbar](https://sph.washington.edu/sph-profiles/faculty-profiles/ali-rowhani-rahbar).
