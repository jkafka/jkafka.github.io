I am a PhD-trained public health researcher dedicated to the prevention of violence, including intimate partner violence (IPV), firearm violence, and suicide. I believe that to prevent harm, we need to understand the social and structural forces that lead people to engage in harm in the first place, and to consider how and where to find and support individuals who are at the greatest risk. In my research, I utilize mixed methods approaches including integration of qualitative methods, text mining, natural language processing, quasi-experimental research designs, and epidemiological surveillance approaches.

Currently, I work as a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Washington in the [Firearms Injury & Policy Research Program](https://sph.washington.edu/public-health-research/FIPRP) under the mentorship of [Dr. Fred Rivara](https://sph.washington.edu/sph-profiles/faculty-profiles/fred-rivara) and [Dr. Ali Rowhani-Rahbar](https://sph.washington.edu/sph-profiles/faculty-profiles/ali-rowhani-rahbar).
