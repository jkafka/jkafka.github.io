I am a PhD-trained public health researcher dedicated to the prevention of intimate partner violence, firearm violence, suicide, and self-harm. My goal is to build an evidence base to guide policy and actionable approaches to support individuals and their families who ehave been impacted by violence or suicidality, while interrupting abusive behaviors and/or self-harm among perpetrators of violence. I specialize in the use of mixed methods including integration of qualitative methods, text mining, natural language processing, quasi-experimental research designs, and epidemiological surveillance approaches.

Currently, I work as a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Washington in the Firearms Injury & Policy Research Program. I am privelaged to be  under the mentorship of [Dr. Fred Rivara](https://sph.washington.edu/sph-profiles/faculty-profiles/fred-rivara) and [Dr. Ali Rowhani-Rahbar](https://sph.washington.edu/sph-profiles/faculty-profiles/ali-rowhani-rahbar).
