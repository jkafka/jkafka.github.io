<img align="left" height="3000px" width="250px" src="/headshot.jpg" alt="Headshot"> I am a PhD-trained public health researcher dedicated to the prevention of intimate partner violence. My goal is to build an evidence base to guide policy and actionable approaches to support victim-survivors and their families while interrupting abusive behaviors among perpetrators of violence. To date, I have specialized in the use of mixed methods including integration of qualitative methods, text mining, natural language processing, quasi-experimental research designs, and epidemiological surveillance approaches.

Currently, I work as a Postdoctoral Scholar at the University of Washington under the mentorship of [Dr. Fred Rivara](https://sph.washington.edu/sph-profiles/faculty-profiles/fred-rivara) and [Dr. Ali Rowhani-Rahbar](https://sph.washington.edu/sph-profiles/faculty-profiles/ali-rowhani-rahbar).
